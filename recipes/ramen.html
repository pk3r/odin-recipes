    <h2 class="main-desc">Description</h2>
    <p class="main-text">Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken, fresh veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg. 
        Inspired by traditional Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour.</p>

    <h3 class="main-ingre">Ingredients</h3>        
    <ul class= "main-text">
        <li>2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="main-lists">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="main-text">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. 
            Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. 
            Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). 
            Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. 
            Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!</li>
