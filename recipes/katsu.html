    <h2 class="main-desc">Description</h2>
    <p class="main-text">Katsu curry is super-delicious and is one of Japanâ€™s most popular dishes. Its heart is Indian spices, which were brought through the spice trade to Britain, 
        where we manufactured our first curry powder; then, back again through trade, they went to Japan</p>

    <h3 class="main-ingre">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class= "main-text">
        <li>4 x 150g free-range skinless boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 heaped teaspoons medium curry powder</li>
        <li>1 mug of basmati rice , (300g)</li>
        <li>120 g panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>25 g creamed coconut</li>
        <li>250 ml buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="main-lists">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="main-text">
        <li>Press down firmly with the palm of your hand to slightly flatten each chicken breast. 
            Place them in a bowl, pour over the buttermilk, add the curry powder and a pinch of sea salt, 
            crush in the garlic, then toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Fry in a large pan on a medium low heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the spices for 15 minutes, 
            or until starting to caramelize, stirring regularly.</li>
        <li>To serve, put a quarter of the rice into a small bowl, press to compact and turn out on to a plate, then repeat with the other portions. 
            Place the chicken next to the rice, cover with the sauce, then sprinkle over the pickle and the coriander leaves.</li>
    </ol>
